            The best menus in Abuja, Chef Laurent Mathieu in the kitchen
            prepares a seasonal menu that is regularly renewed, with French and
            more broadly European specialities, influenced by the continent and
            for those nostalgic for French cuisine. The plates are neat, the
            setting chic and spacious. The top of the range service enhanced by
            soft music, sometimes replaced by that of the grand piano. A wide
            selection of wines, and the "grill" appellation obliges, of meat

            Nestled in a green setting in the heart of Abuja's botanical garden
            Cilantro has one of the most beautiful settings in the city. This
            restaurant opened in 2018. Cilantro is a delight to behold, even the
            climate seems unique, with a few degrees lower than in the rest of
            the city, for this lush setting of palm trees and century-old trees
            that are coloured with multiple illuminations in the evening. The
            menu of refined Indian dishes is just as seductive. the cocktails
            are excellent

            Expensive card for the city, but carnivores will have enough to eat
            with an American touch on T-bones, rib eyes and other sirloins. As
            its name suggests, we come here for meat! A variety of Mexican
            dishes are also available, including traditional fajitas and
            quesadillas, as well as pasta and sandwiches. Classic grey and white
            interior, some paintings and a pretty miniature cellar. Also a
            beautiful outdoor bar in the arty style. Will you dare the 700 gram
            portion?

            The staffs is very welcoming and the menu focuses on meats, Mexico
            and Italy, in an original but successful mix. So you can try the
            T-Bone, Tenderloin or the "Espetada", the famous giant skewers that
            are a sensation once served. Italian pasta and burgers also hold up
            well. For drinks, a wide selection of wines, beers from the Bature
            brewery and good coffees. a good address!
